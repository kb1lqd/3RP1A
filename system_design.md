# Overview

This file contains general notes about the system design that will implement all of the needed circuitry.

# Sub-Systems Needed

These are the sub-system functionalities that I believe I need.

* **Power Supplies**
  * High Voltage (Electron Gun)
    * Accelerating anode
    * Focusing anode (voltage divide down?)
  * High Voltage (Deflection)
  * Low voltage (Heater)
* **Amplifier**
  * Deflection amplifier (differential?)
